This is a companion codebase for the article "A Surface-based Heat source Model for Thermomechanical Simulation of Additive Friction Stir Deposition Process . T.Ruvo, A. Sarker, S. Liao, S. Saha‚Äù

This repository is based on the [AM_Thermomechanical_Solver](https://github.com/ShuhengLiao/AM_Thermomechanical_Solver) code. The current implementation modifies the original source code, adds the new thermal model, and implements for AFSD simulation.

To understand how to generate the toolpath and geometry file, please refer to https://github.com/NU-IDEAS-Lab/ded_dt_thermomechanical_solver

The current implementation has all the dependencies mentioned and requires the same packages mentioned in https://github.com/NU-IDEAS-Lab/ded_dt_thermomechanical_solver

The input geometry is provided for one case as representative case. Other cases will be released upon publication.
